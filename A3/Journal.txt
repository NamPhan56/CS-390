Problems
hm... had some problems with setup, specifically referencing R variables.
Seems like this is a problem for images as well, which needs to be declared and instanitated in the drawable class.

Working
Fixed! R.java needs to be ran in order for it to declare and instantiate variables.


Notes
playing around with main.xml is pretty kewl.
okay now all setup is done!
we need to add 4 more visualizations to the current 4 which are the MyActivities Icons.
Because our project used running, driving, and sitting, I will go and find icons for that. 
Icons aren't important right now, I need to find a way to set up image switching.
maybe use a case-switch for images
apparently, java 1.6 won't let me use case-switches with Strings for Arguments
apparenlty java 1.7 won't compile on anything lower than Android 4.4 (KitKat)
my phone doesn't have an official 4.4 offical update available. Grrr! so no case-switching for me :(
